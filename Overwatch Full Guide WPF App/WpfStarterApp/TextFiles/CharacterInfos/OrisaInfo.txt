Orisa is a tank hero in overwatch

Orisa serves as the central anchor of her team, and defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She can attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once
Orisa is a newly-created omnic with both a heart and personality. Urged to become a hero by her creator, Efi Oladele, Orisa strives to right wrongs and act as the hero the world needs. While her relative inexperience can make her an occasional liability, Efi's optimism and willingness to make modifications to Orisa's adaptive artificial intelligence have always been able to set things right. While Orisa has much to learn about the world and its functionality, Orisa stands ready to protect both Efi and Numbani with her growing sense of honor and duty.
She is a fan of Lúcio's music. She does not dream in the manner that humans do. Orisa was created by Numbani local and child genius Efi Oladele from pieces of dismantled OR15 defense robots in the wake of Doomfist's attack on the Numbani airport. With the OR15 being initially created to protect Numbani from the many threats it faced, the aftermath of Doomfist's attack resulted in the decommissioning of the OR15 and a staggering drop in public confidence. Never giving up hope in the OR15s original purpose and believing that Numbani needed a protector, Efi acquired one of the decommissioned bots for sale by the civil government using the bulk of her grant money received by the Adawe Foundation. Efi repaired and reconfigured the robot and installed a personality core she had designed herself. She then named her new creation Orisa.
