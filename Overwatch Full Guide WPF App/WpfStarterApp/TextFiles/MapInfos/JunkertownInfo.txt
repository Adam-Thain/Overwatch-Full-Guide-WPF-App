Shanty town, desert

Junkertown is an Escort map in Overwatch. 

Junkertown is an Escort map located in the harsh and unforgiving Australian Outback. Constructed from the remains of a destroyed omnium, it's now the home to a band of lawless scavengers known as the Junkers, led by their cutthroat Queen. When they aren’t pillaging the omnium's skeleton for anything of value, the Junkers blow off steam in the Scrapyard—a massive gladiatorial arena whose combatants fight for glory, riches...and to survive.
Junkertown is a dirty, dangerous, harsh, chaotic, grungy settlement located in the Australian Outback, constructed from the ruins of the Australian omnium. It is the home of the Junkers, and ruled by an individual called "the Queen". The entrance to the town is a fortified gate with a guard tower. The denizens of the town are taxed, and if they don't pay up, the Queen sends her henchmen around to collect what's due. Junkertown does have some amenities that one would expect from a proper town—repair shops, bars, tattoo shops, etc.
The payload consists of the riches Junkrat and Roadhog collected in their global heist spree along with a "surprise" of explosive as revenge for being exiled. The spawn for the attacking team is initially placed at Roadhog's farm, with the payload being escorted throughout the desert and Junkertown.
