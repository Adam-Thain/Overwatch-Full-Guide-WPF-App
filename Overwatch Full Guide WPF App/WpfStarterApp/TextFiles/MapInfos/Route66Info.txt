Escort
Arizona, USA
Desert Road

Route 66 is an Escort map in Overwatch. In this case, the payload contains Echo, who was released during the events of Reunion. 

Though the travelers and road trippers who used to cross the US on historic Route 66 are gone, the Main Street of America still stands, a testament to a simpler time. The gas stations, roadside shops, and cafes have gone into disuse, and the fabled Deadlock Gorge is mostly seen from the comfort of transcontinental train cars. But amid the fading monuments of that earlier era, the outlaws of the Deadlock Gang are planning their biggest heist yet.
There are a lot of vantage points in Route 66. If you are a sniper, it is a good map to get to a high point and pick off enemies. It is also a good map for Torbjorn to set up his turrets and Hanzo to use dragonstrike. This is also one of the best maps for Pharah. This is also good for Lucio, who can knock people off of cliffs.
At the start of the map, your main defense should be the roof of the building near the first checkpoint because it has high ground and is in a good position. In the second portion, you want to keep the high ground and skirmish with the enemy team. You don't really need to be grouped up completely with your team in this section. In the last section, you want to group up near the ending checkpoint and attack the enemy as they come around the corner to create a good choke point. Bastion is almost always a good hero holding the right train car as well as the payload if he's paired with a Orisa.
