City Area

Busan is a Control map in Overwatch. 

Busan City came under attack by the Gwishin omnics. MEKA successfully defeated them, but at the cost of all their mechs bar the one piloted by D.Va and some damage to the city itself. They attacked the city again one week later, in contrast to the usual gap of months. This left only D.Va to defend the city, but she managed to destroy the attackers.
Each turn is played on one of the three sections of the map: Downtown Sanctuary MEKA Base
