Control
Nepal
Monastery

Nepal is a Control map in Overwatch. 

Years ago, a group of omnic robots experienced what they described as a spiritual awakening. They abandoned their programmed lives to establish a monastery high in the Himalayas, where like-minded omnics could gather to meditate on the nature of their existence. Led by their spiritual leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, they took over the ruins of an ancient monastery and turned it into the home of the Shambali, a place where omnics and humans alike make pilgrimages in the hopes of finding a greater truth. 
Each round is played on one of the three sections of the map: Village Shrine Sanctum
In Nepal, the Sanctum and Village maps are great for Mei, because she can put up her Ice Wall to block the entrance. Symmetra can be utilized well in Sanctum by placing her turrets and teleporter in the back room by the point and/or the room above. 
Heroes with push abilities such as Pharah's Concussive Blast and Lúcio's Soundwave can use said abilities to push enemies off the point to their deaths in Sanctum. D.Va and Junkrat are also capable doing this but is harder to pull off for inexperienced players. Winston and Roadhog are also capable but only while they use ultimate ability; Primal Rage and Whole Hog.
