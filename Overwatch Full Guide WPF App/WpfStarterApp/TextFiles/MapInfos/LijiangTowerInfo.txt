Lijiang Tower is a Control map in Overwatch. 

Lijiang Tower was built in the heart of a modern Chinese metropolis, its busy streets lined with stores, gardens, restaurants, and famous night markets, where foods from around the region are available at all hours. The tower itself is home to one of the leading companies in China's state-of-the-art space industry, Lucheng Interstellar, an organization with a long pioneering history that is currently pushing the boundaries of space exploration.
Each turn is played on one of the three sections of the map: Night Market Garden Control Center
Pharah, Junkrat and Soldier 76 can use their explosives, (Rockets, Concussion mines, and Helix rocket respectively) to push enemies off the bridge. Lucio can wall ride near the bridge to easily boop enemies. Mercy can and will hide behind the rock near the bridge to keep her Revive safe. The windows on the objective in Lijiang Tower can be used for surprise attacks, the best heroes for this would probably be Genji and Pharah. This map also has a lot of holes to fall into which is both an advantage and a threat to Lucio, Junkrat, Winston and D.va.
